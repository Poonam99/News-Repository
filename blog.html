                    <p>Var:
                        The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
                        It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
                        It can be declared without initialization.
                        It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let:
                        The scope of a let variable is block scope.
                        It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
                        It can be declared without initialization.
                        It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.

                    </p>
                    <p> Const:
                        The scope of a const variable is block scope.
                        It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
                        It cannot be declared without initialization.
                        It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.
