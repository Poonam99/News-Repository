                    <p>Var:
                        The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
                        It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
                        It can be declared without initialization.
                        It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let:
                        The scope of a let variable is block scope.
                        It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
                        It can be declared without initialization.
                        It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.

                    </p>
                    <p> Const:
                        The scope of a const variable is block scope.
                        It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
                        It cannot be declared without initialization.
                        It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

                    <p>Regular Function:
                        Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic.
                        The regular function can easily construct objects and can be used as a constructor.
                        Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the
                        list of arguments with which the function has been invoked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arrow Function
                        The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular
                        function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.
                        A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a
                        constructor.
                        No arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.
